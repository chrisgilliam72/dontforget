DontForget Xamarin Project
 Shopping list app I wrote in Xamarin to teach myself Xamarin. Yes, I know I didn't use MVVM pattern for this project. The aim was to learn and demonstrate Xamarin capabilities in as short time as possible. This is not the limit of my technical skills this is the only thing I could write in the limited time I had available to demonstrate my understanding of as many Xamarin concepts as possible.
 You can find the actual app on the apple app store . Search for DontForgetShoppingList. Please buy it, its only R14,99 and its actually pretty useful!
